  "description": "This mod is an addon to the Chisels & Bits mod. It adds a wrench that rotates/mirrors/translates/inverts chiseled blocks, sculpting wires/spades that remove/add cuboidal/ellipsoidal/cylindrical/conic/pyramidal areas of bits from chiseled/chiselable blocks, a modeling tool that makes chiseled block models of 16^3 areas of blocks in the world, and armor pieces that render chiseled blocks (and any items) as their moving parts. It also allows chisel designs to be edited and bits to be thrown like snowballs.",
