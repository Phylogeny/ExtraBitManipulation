Extra Bit Manipulation
----------------------

This mod is an addon to the Chisels & Bits mod. It adds a wrench that rotates/mirrors/translates/inverts chiseled blocks, sculpting wires/spades that remove/add cuboidal/ellipsoidal/cylindrical/conic/pyramidal areas of bits from chiseled/chiselable blocks, and a modeling tool that makes chiseled block models of 16^3 areas of blocks in the world. It also allows chisel designs to be edited and bits to be thrown like snowballs.
