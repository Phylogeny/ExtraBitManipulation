Extra Bit Manipulation
----------------------

This mod is an addon to the Chisels & Bits mod. It adds the following items:
1. **A Wrench** that rotates/mirrors/translates/inverts chiseled blocks.
2. **Sculpting Wires/Spades** that remove/add cuboidal/ellipsoidal/cylindrical/conic/pyramidal areas of bits from chiseled/chiselable blocks.
3. **A Modeling Tool** that makes chiseled block models of 16^3 areas of blocks in the world.
4. **Armor Pieces** that render chiseled blocks (and any items) as their moving parts.

It also allows:
1. **Chisel designs** to be edited.
2. **Bits** to be thrown like snowballs.
